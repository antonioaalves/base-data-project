# Intermediate Data Storage Strategy Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a flexible intermediate data storage strategy in the Base Data Project framework. The feature will allow configurable storage of intermediary data from processing stages in memory or persistent storage (database/CSV) based on project needs.

## Business Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Enable configurable storage of intermediate stage results (memory vs. persistent storage)
- Support both CSV and database persistence options
- Allow selective persistence of specific stages
- Maintain performance while adding storage flexibility
- Provide easy access to historical stage results

### Benefits
- Improved debugging capabilities through preservation of intermediate steps
- Reduced memory usage when necessary through selective persistence
- Better auditability of process execution
- Enhanced ability to analyze and compare different process runs
- More efficient resource utilization

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Abstract Data Container Interface

#### 1.1 BaseDataContainer Class
- Define an abstract base class with standardized interface
- Implement memory storage capabilities by default
- Include methods for storing, retrieving, and managing intermediate data
- Support metadata storage alongside data
- Enable configuration-driven storage decisions

#### 1.2 Required Methods
- `store_stage_data(stage_name, data, metadata)`: Store data from a processing stage
- `retrieve_stage_data(stage_name, [process_id])`: Retrieve data for a stage
- `list_available_data(filters)`: Discover available intermediate data
- `cleanup(policy)`: Manage stored data lifecycle

### 2. Configuration Structure

#### 2.1 Storage Strategy Configuration
```
'storage_strategy': {
    'mode': 'memory',  # Options: 'memory', 'persist', 'hybrid'
    'persist_intermediate_results': False,
    'stages_to_persist': [],  # Empty list means all stages
    'cleanup_policy': 'keep_latest',  # Options: 'keep_all', 'keep_latest', 'keep_none'
}
```

#### 2.2 Configuration Hierarchy
- Global default settings
- Project-specific overrides
- Stage-specific settings
- Runtime decisions

### 3. Integration with Data Managers

#### 3.1 CSV Data Manager Extensions
- Store intermediate data in structured directory
- Support metadata files alongside data files
- Implement file-based indexing for data discovery

#### 3.2 Database Manager Extensions
- Use a standardized table structure for intermediate data
- Store process_id as foreign key for linking to process information
- Support both inline data storage and reference-based storage for large datasets

#### 3.3 Common Features
- Error handling for storage/retrieval failures
- Performance monitoring
- Space usage tracking
- Automatic cleanup based on configuration

### 4. Process Management Integration

#### 4.1 ProcessStageHandler Extensions
- Add calls to data container at stage completion
- Store decision information alongside data
- Enhance progress tracking with storage information

#### 4.2 Service Integration
- Initialize data container with appropriate configuration
- Use data container for stage data management
- Support retrieval of previous stage results

### 5. API Support

#### 5.1 Data Discovery Endpoints
- List available intermediate data for a process
- Query historical process results
- Support filtering by stage, timestamp, etc.

#### 5.2 Data Access Endpoints
- Retrieve specific stage results
- Compare results between processes
- Export data for external analysis

## Database Schema

### Intermediate Data Table
```
intermediate_data
├── id (primary key)
├── process_id (foreign key to processes table)
├── stage_name (string)
├── entity_name (string)
├── storage_type (enum: 'inline', 'reference')
├── data_reference (string - table name, file path, etc.)
├── metadata (jsonb)
├── created_at (timestamp)
└── size_bytes (bigint)
```

## Implementation Constraints

### 1. Performance
- Memory mode should add minimal overhead
- Persistence operations should not significantly impact processing time
- Data retrieval should be efficient

### 2. Memory Management
- Implement proper reference management for memory-stored data
- Provide explicit methods to release memory
- Add safety measures to prevent out-of-memory conditions

### 3. Compatibility
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing projects
- Provide migration path for project-specific implementations
- Support gradual adoption of new features

### 4. Security
- Ensure proper access controls for stored data
- Implement data cleanup for sensitive information
- Support encryption for stored data when necessary

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- Define abstract data container interface
- Implement memory storage capabilities
- Add basic configuration options
- Create reference implementations

### Phase 2: Persistence Extension
- Implement CSV and database persistence strategies
- Add metadata handling and storage
- Create data discovery mechanisms
- Integrate with existing managers

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add lifecycle management
- Implement advanced querying capabilities
- Create comparison tools
- Add performance optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Projects can configure whether intermediate data is stored in memory or persisted
2. Performance impact is minimal for memory-only mode
3. Persistent storage correctly maintains intermediate results
4. Data can be retrieved from earlier stages as needed
5. Historical process data can be accessed and compared
6. Configuration options work as expected
7. Memory management prevents resource exhaustion
8. Documentation provides clear usage examples
