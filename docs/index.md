# Base Data Project Framework

## Overview

The Base Data Project Framework is a standardized architecture for data processing projects that aims to ensure consistency across different implementations while reducing boilerplate code and enforcing best practices.

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on how to use the framework to create, develop, and deploy data processing projects that benefit from standardized patterns and components.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Architecture**: Consistent project structure and interfaces across implementations
- **Data Management**: Abstract over different data sources (CSV, database) with a unified interface
- **Process Management**: Track multi-stage execution with decisions and progress monitoring
- **Algorithm Framework**: Standard patterns for implementing data processing algorithms
- **Project Templates**: Quickly bootstrap new projects with built-in templates

## Documentation Contents

- [Getting Started](getting_started.md): Quick setup and first steps
- [Data Management](data_management.md): Working with the data layer
- [Process Management](process_management.md): Understanding the process execution framework
- [Algorithms](algorithms.md): Implementing and using processing algorithms
- [Examples](examples.md): Example projects and use cases

## Installation

```bash
pip install base-data-project
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new project with the default template
base-data-project init my_new_project

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my_new_project

# Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run interactive mode
python main.py run-process
```

## Design Philosophy

The Base Data Project Framework was designed with these principles in mind:

1. **Consistency**: Standardized interfaces and patterns reduce cognitive load when switching between projects
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data access, business logic, and execution flow
3. **Visibility**: Built-in logging, process tracking, and progress monitoring
4. **Extensibility**: Well-defined extension points for custom logic
5. **Low Overhead**: Minimal impact on performance while providing structure

## Who Should Use This Framework

- Data scientists who want to create more maintainable and production-ready code
- Engineering teams building multiple data processing applications
- Organizations looking to standardize their approach to data applications
- Anyone who wants to reduce boilerplate in data pipeline development
